Until now, available therapies were few and unreliable, but recent understanding of melanomas' molecular pathways has improve their classification and new clinical strategies have been proposed.

Initial studies showed that B-Raf/N-Ras mutations (respectively V600E and Q61) are the most frequent alteration being present in 70 to 80% of melanomas, characterizing non Chronic Sun-induced Damage skins (CSD). These include Superficial Spreading Melanomas (SSM) and Nodular Melanomas (NM). Other studies showed that c-Kit mutations are presently the predominant activating mutation (20 - 40 %) in Acro-Lentiginous Melanomas (ALM), Mucous Melanomas (MM) and in melanomas arising on CSD skin. c-Kit mutation pattern is more complex with four exons being affected leading to different mutations, which incidence and biological impact are less documented.

BRAF/NRAS genetics alterations drive constantly cell growth, being thus attractive targets. Spectacular results have indeed been obtained with the BRAF inhibitor that targets the V600E BRAF-mutated form. Data from GIST disease revealed that the different c-Kit mutations modulate differently c-Kit function and the response to targeted therapies.

Because c-Kit targeted therapy is a critical clinical issue, the investigators aimed to identify the most frequent mutations present in our population to propose appropriate screening test and adapt the therapy.

Methods: 250 melanoma samples corresponding to an homogeneous white-Caucasian population (Brittany, France) will be screened. c-Kit exons 11, 13, 17 and 18 will be sequenced (direct sequencing and pyrosequencing when possible). c-Kit copy number will be quantified by q-PCR and level of c-Kit determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, CD117). Samples will also be analyzed for B-Raf mutations in codon 464, 466, 469 and 600, and for N-Ras mutations in codon 12, 13 and 61 (Pyrosequencing).

Expected Results:

Taken together, the investigators anticipate that the present genetic analysis of the tumours from patients with advanced melanoma will first document the type and frequency of cKit mutations, will confirm or not that BRAF, NRAS and cKit mutations are mutually exclusive and document their repartition in the melanomas sub-types. Finally this study will clue researchers in to how well patients will respond to a therapy that targets the growth-promoting proteins BRAF/NRAS and cKIT.";2011-01-28T00:00:00;;Completed;2014-02-28T00:00:00;Actual;2012-02-21T00:00:00;2012-03-01T00:00:00;Interventional;;288.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Centre Eugène Marquis', 'Rennes University Hospital'];2022-11-28;2011.0;2014.0;389.0;during_study;1127.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Other;N/A;Diagnostic;;;;;;;;;

Survival rate is more than 70%, but in some cases, curative treatments are not sufficient and palliative support is implemented for those children in end of life.

Pediatric guidelines about the place of end-of-life care are varied. On European scale, home is recommended (IMPaCCT study, 2007). In France, the 2008-2012 palliative care development program recommended home or initial hospital care unit. This program also supports implementation of mobile team rather than specific hospital units.

In Brittany, a pattern of regional palliative care resource team has been implemented since 2005. In oncology, further to the guidelines, end-of-life place of care is often discussed several times for each case. Sometimes occur a lot of returns between home and hospital, psychological difficulties, and difficulties to offer adapted care conditions. Finally, less than 30% of children in palliative care decease at home.

The primary objective is to identify main determinants of the place of palliative care in pediatric oncology.

The secondary objective is to clarify the factors of change comparing to the initial planned place.

Intervention :

Questionnaire completed by the parents Interview with the parents and the psychologist (University Rennes 2)

Number of subjects is : Parents of 68 to 93 children who died from cancer after a palliative phase, that means 136 to 186 parents.

Expected results and perspectives :

Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, expected results are the followings:

Identification of the objective and subjective factors, which influenced the decision of the place of care.
Determination of the factors of change comparing to the initial planned place.

Once identified, main factors could be the ones to pay attention to in order to help for initial decision, better anticipation of change of place and better guidance of palliative care organization wherever, at home or in hospital.

Results would be new information for research on palliative care for children but also for adults.

Finally, this work is part of an improving approach of palliative care, related to the development of open-care hospital networks.

This technique would allow patients to regulate their cortical electroencephalographic activity while receiving a visual or auditory feedback on the cortical electroencephalographic activity. Changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) would thus be correlated with changes in cortical activity and thus with symptoms.

On the electroencephalographic plane, the depression appears associated with relatively more alpha activity (in ""resting state"", 8-13 Hz) in left than in right frontal cortex. This difference in alpha activity between frontal regions is known as alpha asymmetry in depression. As a reminder, increased alpha activity indicates a decrease in cortical activation. This alpha asymmetry appears to be associated with a decrease in sensitivity to reward.

It is on these bases that the modification of the alpha asymmetry has become one of the most frequent objectives of the studies on the use of neurofeedback in depression.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) also offers a non-invasive and painless method of effective cerebral stimulation in psychiatric disorders and especially depression. It received a favorable opinion from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for the treatment of this pathology. This treatment is still under evaluation in France. The results are promising but improvements must be done to increase its effectiveness.

TMS offers stimulation of brain tissue in a localized and non-invasive manner. The principle consists of a brief electric current passing through a coil which generates a transient magnetic field inducing an electric field through conductive fabrics. TMS modifies neuronal activity in target superficial brain structures, but also modulates neuronal circuit activity.

In recent years, the concept of ""state dependency TMS"" has been developed. It suggests that the activation state of neuronal circuits before and after stimulation alters the effect of stimulation. Thus, the efficacy of TMS could be amplified in depression by taking into account the cerebral activity during the stimulation sessions, in particular on the electroencephalographic plane.

However, TMS may also help patients increase their EEG response during Neurofeedback sessions.

The combination of stimulation techniques and brain-machine interfaces such as neurofeedback is still little studied at present.

A study on the combined use of TMS and Neurofeedback by EEG in depression would therefore be an innovative approach and in line with the latest data from the literature.

Population Based Case-control Study Short Title : Malformations and Environment Acronym : PENEW for ""Pregnancy Environment and Newborn Malformations""";PENEW;"Congenital malformations rate is about 3% in France. There are already 5 registries in France, covering about 16% of French births: Paris Registry, (about 38 000 births /year), Alsace Registry, (about 23 000 births/year), Rhône-Alpes Registry, (about 56 000 births/year), Auvergne Registry, (about 14 000 births/year), and la Réunion Registry. The aim of malformation registries is to carry out epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies. The objectives are mainly to provide essential epidemiologic information on congenital anomalies, to facilitate the early warning of teratogenic exposures, to act as an information and resource centre regarding clusters, to provide data for research related to the causes and prevention of congenital anomalies.

A previous study was carried out in Brittany in 2008-2009, by the perinatal network of Ille et Vilaine, in collaboration with two research teams (Inserm U1085 and Inserm U 936), to record all cases of 4 types of congenital anomalies: congenital heart disease, spina bifida, diaphragmatic hernia and hypospadia. The results showed prevalence rates similar to those observed by Eurocat for spina bifida and diaphragmatic hernia, but a higher prevalence regarding congenital heart diseases and hypospadia. In this study the investigators could not determine whether this was due to a real higher frequency or to a particular exhaustiveness in the recording methodology.

There are hypothesis about the role of intrauterine exposure to pesticides, known as endocrine disruptors, and the risk of congenital genital anomalies. Brittany is an intensive agricultural area, and it is thus worth studying the impact of pesticides exposure on congenital anomalies.

There are also hypothesis on the impact of occupational exposure to solvents on congenital anomalies (Garlantezec 2009), and on the role of alcohol exposure (which concerns about 8% pregnant women in France) on oro-facial clefts and congenital heart diseases.

The Registry of congenital anomalies in Brittany was set up in 2010. The main aim is to study the impact of intra-uterine exposure to solvents, pesticides and alcohol on the risk of congenital malformations diagnosed at births, by measuring the exposure both directly in meconium, and indirectly by questionnaires.

Secondary objectives are to study other risk factors such as medicine intake, pregnancy illness…";2012-10-05T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2020-12-31T00:00:00;Actual;2012-05-24T00:00:00;2012-06-06T00:00:00;Interventional;;1657.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Polyclinique de Keraudren', 'Saint-Brieuc Hospital', 'Vannes Hospital', 'Ploermel Hospital', 'Brest University Hospital', 'Clinique Océane', 'Lannion Hospital', 'Saint-Grégoire Hospital', 'Rennes University Hospital', 'Quimper Hospital', 'Lorient Hospital'];2022-11-28;2012.0;2020.0;-134.0;before_start;3009.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Other;Non-Randomized;Other;;;;;;;;;

The timeliness of revascularisation is an essential factor of good prognosis. This intra-arterial treatment, associated with thrombolysis if applicable, is the reference treatment of large-vessel occlusion. The stillness of the patient is required to control the safety of the recanalization. Currently, either a general anesthesia or a sedation can be performed.

Several studies have shown a trend to superiority of the sedation but none was conducted with a high level of proof methodology.

Lymphopenia characteristic of severe forms of ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection may be linked to expansion of MDSCs and arginine depletion of lymphocytes.

Severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonitis are marked by persistent ARDS with acquisition of nosocomial infections as well as by prolonged lymphocytic dysfunction associated with the emergence of MDSC.

It has been found in intensive care patients hypoargininaemia, associated with the persistence of organ dysfunction (evaluated by the SOFA score), the occurrence of nosocomial infections and mortality. Also, it has been demonstrated that in these patients, the enteral administration of ARG was not deleterious and increased the synthesis of ornithine, suggesting a preferential use of ARG by the arginase route, without significant increase in argininaemia nor effect on immune functions. L-citrulline (CIT), an endogenous precursor of ARG, is an interesting alternative to increase the availability of ARG. Recent data demonstrate that the administration of CIT in intensive care is not deleterious and that it very significantly reduces mortality in an animal model of sepsis, corrects hypoargininemia, with convincing data on immunological parameters such as lymphopenia, which is associated with mortality, organ dysfunction and the occurrence of nosocomial infections. The availability of ARG directly impacts the mitochondrial metabolism of T lymphocytes and their function. The hypothesis is therefore that CIT supplementation is more effective than the administration of ARG to correct hypoargininaemia, decrease lymphocyte dysfunction, correct immunosuppression and organ dysfunction in septic patients admitted to intensive care.

The main objective is to show that, in patients hospitalized in intensive care for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia, the group of patients receiving L-citrulline for 7 days, compared to the group receiving placebo, has a score of organ failure decreased on D7 (evaluated by the SOFA score) or by the last known SOFA score if the patient has died or been resuscitated.";2020-11-04T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2021-05-28T00:00:00;Actual;2020-05-22T00:00:00;2020-05-25T00:00:00;Interventional;;33.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;Undecided;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Rennes University Hospital'];2022-11-28;2020.0;2021.0;-166.0;before_start;205.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Dietary Supplement;Randomized;Treatment;;;;;;;;;

The diagnosis is based on the criteria defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification: oliguria and elevation of serum creatinine. However, oliguria is not specific of AKI and elevation of serum creatinine is too late. Therefore, new methods have been developed to earlier assess the risk of AKI.

Among those methods, it has been shown that the increase of urinary dosage, in the hours following the surgery, of two proteins (Tissue Inhibitor of Metallo-Protease 2 (TIMP2) and Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7)) is associated with an increased risk of occurrence of AKI in patients hospitalized in intensive care unit. The Nephrocheck® test combines the urinary dosage of those two proteins TIMP2 and IGFBP7.

Creation, Implementation and Testing of an Augmented Reality Tool to Help People With Alzheimer's Type Dementia in Their Travels.;ARIADE;"Navigating according to a specific goal is a common activity of everyday life. Spatial navigation requires the implementation of motor and perceptual functions (sight, walking, proprioception), but also various cognitive functions (executive functions, memory, spatial orientation skills). Many people affected by a neurodegenerative disease have topographical difficulties which have a major impact on their autonomy in daily life, by gradually limiting their movements outside their home, then inside their home, and which are the main factor leading to the institutionalization of this population. People with dementia or MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) of the Alzheimer type, according to the definition of the NIAA (National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association) have navigation and spatial memory disorders, with difficulty in acquiring mental spatial representations of their environment. These topographical difficulties have been shown to be related to the reduction in volume of the temporal cortex, in particular the hippocampal regions, as well as to atrophy of the retrosplenial cortex.

Augmented Reality (AR), often defined as an intermediary between the totally artificial world of VR and the real world in which we operate, makes it possible in particular to add summary information to the natural environment in which a participant operates. Even if, in particular in outside environment, AR must solve many challenges, such as the integration of the real and virtual worlds in real time, the selection of the modalities of restitution of information, its use is exponential in the medical field, in particular in surgery for the assistance of the practitioner, but also in the field of sensory substitution, in particular to facilitate the movements of people with visual impairment. Other works focused in helping people with dementia of the Alzheimer type, such as those of Quintana and Favela (2012) who proposed preliminary systems of annotations in AR. Hervás et al. were the first in 2014 to test the use of augmented reality to provide navigation assistance to people with dementia. In 2017, Firouzian et al. as well as Sejunaite et al. implemented related systems. Firouzian et al. have developed spectacle frames comprising around ten LED lights in order to provide directional indications to people who moved outdoor. However, the influence of this system on navigation performance has not been tested yet. On the other hand, although simple to develop, this system requires training on the part of the users and only makes it possible to provide directional information, which is not recommended for the implementation of a tool for this population. Finally, Sejunaite et al. used an environmentally tested smart glasses to allow users to display information in the form of a map to help older people navigate independently. However, the literature review indicates that even increased card use does not seem to be suitable for people with dementia or Alzheimer's-type MCI. Finally, these two tools do not allow navigational information to be co-located in the field of vision of people, which represents one of the major advantages of augmented reality. To our knowledge, there is not yet an AR device providing co-located information in the environment dedicated to outdoor navigation of people with dementia or Alzheimer's type MCI.";2021-06-07T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2021-06-25T00:00:00;Actual;2021-02-01T00:00:00;2021-02-05T00:00:00;Interventional;;19.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;No;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Rennes University Hospital'];2022-11-28;2021.0;2021.0;-126.0;before_start;18.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Other;N/A;Other;;;;;;;;;

It is important to optimize the diagnosis to ensure support for patients and their relatives especially regarding genetic disease.

Iron overload revealed by a high level of serum ferritin and confirmed by the presence of an excessive amount of iron in the liver is a frequent situation. In a lot of case there is no increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation. This situation may arise in particular in patients with:

a genetic iron overload related to mutation in the ferroportine gene, leading to a ferroportin disease. The diagnosis is based on the sequencing of the gene,
a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, the most frequent situation , where iron overload is associated with abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, whereas no genetic cause is identified.

However, patients often have similar biological signs and despite the implementation of strict algorithm regarding the diagnostic procedure, it appears that a large number of patients are tested for the mutation in the ferroportin gene, and that mutation is not found in most cases. It is therefore essential to optimize the diagnosis process by introducing additional criteria.

The investigators' hypothesis, based on the known elements, is that the response to a single dose of iron will modulate differently the iron parameters measured in serum, including hepcidin level which controls iron metabolism and metals associated with iron.

Their efficacy has been shown to be linked to the ratio area under the curve (AUC) of their plasma concentrations over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria treated. Eventually, Forrest et al., reported in gram-negative infections that an AUC/MIC above 125 conducted to a 80 to 90% clinical success whereas success decrease to 30 to 40% in patients with an AUC/MIC below this threshold. These results have been reproduced recently by Zelenitsky et al. in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with threshold similar to the one obtained by Forrest et al. Lastly, elevated concentrations of FQ should be related with the onset of adverse events. Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of FQ appears of potential interest, particularly in case of severe infections (intensive care unit (ICU) patients) or complicated and cost-related infections (osteoarticular infected (OAI) patients), with an increasing level of evidence of its use.

However, FQ TDM requires access to the full AUC of the drug with the need of many samples drawn to patients. This appears to be irreconcilable with clinical practice but can be achieved using population pharmacokinetic (PkPop) modelling. PkPop allows estimating pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug by introducing covariates (demographic, biological, clinical…) and modelling inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. The model created allows then accessing to individual parameters of patients and thus, estimating concentrations and AUC of the FQ. This approach may also be used in clinical practice to determine a limited sampling strategy allowing an adequate estimation of AUC with a minimum of samples.";2015-06-28T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2016-12-28T00:00:00;Actual;2015-01-16T00:00:00;2015-02-02T00:00:00;Interventional;;31.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Rennes University Hospital'];2022-11-28;2015.0;2016.0;-163.0;before_start;549.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Drug;Non-Randomized;Other;;;;;;;;;

These are widely used in physical therapy both for assessment and rehabilitation of patients with balance disorders.

For hemiplegic patients, an asymmetric distribution support on each foot and an increased surface area of postural sways (more marked on the medio lateral axis) are observed.

These studies, based on the study of plantar pressure ,are not enough to providea full description of the spatio-temporal organization of postural components in hemiplegic patients.

Indeed, postural stabilometric evaluation is based on a simplification of the human skeleton by considering it as a simple inverted pendulum swinging on his ankles.

This simplified model can't be used in dynamic assessment because of the simultaneous contributions of several joints during movement. This restricts its clinical interest because patients are more exposed to imbalances and falls in dynamic situations. Thus, the hip angular movement results in a center plantar pressure displacementwhich is impossible to discriminate from the ankle axis movement using stabilometric signal only.

Thus, it seemed interesting to study another variable valid in dynamic conditions : the displacement of center of mass during a dynamic balancing task. This variable is obtained through 3D motion capture of the different segments of the human body. The dynamic test is a dynamic postural assessment following ball avoidance from three different directions. The center of mass displacement will be compared with a functional test known to be representative of dynamic balance of the individual capacities: The Timed Up and Go test (TUG).

All of this data aims to improve the hemiplegic postural assessment for physical therapy and to help develop new rehabilitative approaches.";2015-03-09T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2016-11-23T00:00:00;Actual;2015-01-26T00:00:00;2015-01-28T00:00:00;Interventional;;63.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['CHU Rennes Pontchaillou'];2022-11-28;2015.0;2016.0;-42.0;before_start;625.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Other;Non-Randomized;Other;;;;;;;;;

The CLASH Study.;CLASH;"Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (LEPAD) is a highly prevalent chronic disease. Cardiovascular mortality of LEPAD patients at five years ranges between 18 to 30%. LEPAD is primarily caused by atherosclerosis that induces an inadequate blood flow to meet the tissues demand due to the narrowing of the arteries. An aggravation of the arterial lesions in LEPAD patients induces a worsening of patients' symptoms and a severe limitation of their walking capacity, contributing to an impairment of their quality of life. Despite maintaining a sufficient walking activity is essential for these patients, LEPAD patients lower their physical activity, which worsen the disease and potentially contribute to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and deaths.

In a recent study in LEPAD patients, we showed, from a one hour GPS recording, a high variability of the patients' walking capacity (i.e., walking distances between two stops induced by lower limbs pain). Results suggested that in most patients previous stop duration before each walk was a predictor parameter of this walking variability. Whether there is an optimal or minimal recovery time influencing the walking capacity in LEPAD patients has never been studied.

Its prevalence is increasing and is estimated at 7.5% of people over 40 in France. COPD is responsible for a significant impairment of quality of life and was the 3rd leading cause of death in the world in 2010 when it was 4th place 20 years ago.

However, about 75% of patients with COPD are not diagnosed. Spirometry is the only examination for the diagnosis of COPD. Patients identified at risk for COPD are insufficiently using spirometry and general practitioners (GPs) underestimate the severity of COPD when they do not practice spirometry in their patients. COPD is often diagnosed too late, the disease being discovered at the stage of complications requiring hospitalization. The underdiagnosis is mainly due to poor knowledge of patients, their difficulty in accessing a specialist performing spirometry, their reluctance to perform spirometry, and the insufficient involvement of general practitioners.

Currently in France, targeted screening for COPD and diagnosis in primary care is a major challenge. The international (GOLD 2014) and French (HAS 2014) recommendations do not indicate a systematic screening in the general population for COPD but advocate targeted screening of patients by five questions to identify risk factors and symptoms of COPD. The presence of at least one of these factors in an adult over the age of 40 requires spirometry.

Recent studies suggest the relevance of finding primary care variables for smoking and respiratory symptoms in order to identify new cases of COPD.

However, the impact of the use of these questionnaires on the prevalence of diagnoses of COPD in general practice has not been demonstrated. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the provision of care according to the territories limits a fast or easy access (distance) to the spirometry.

It is therefore necessary to evaluate in primary care the interest of a targeted screening of COPD and the interest of a coordination of care for the realization of a spirometry, in order to improve the rate of diagnosis of the disease.";2017-02-27T00:00:00;Actual;Completed;2019-10-04T00:00:00;Actual;2017-02-01T00:00:00;2017-02-03T00:00:00;Interventional;;3162.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;No;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Rennes'];2022-11-28;2017.0;2019.0;-26.0;before_start;949.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Other;Randomized;Screening;;;;;;;;;

Human milk is considered as the best food for newborns. Several short and long-term beneficial health effects were attributed to breastfeeding and have induced the increase of human milk in preterm newborns nutrition.

Whereas the chemical composition of infant formula has been optimized to mimic human milk, there is still a major difference between the structure of human milk and commercial infant formulas. It is well known in adult nutrition that the structure of emulsions influences their susceptibility to hydrolysis, such results have been obtained either on in vitro or in vivo studies.

Human milk is a natural emulsion (oil in water). Lipids droplets are dispersed under the form of entities called milk fat globules (average diameter 4 µm, span 0.1-20 μm). The globules are stabilized by a trilayered membrane composed mainly of polar lipids (phospholipids, sphingolipids and gangliosides), of proteins, neutral lipids and other minor compounds.

The physical treatments apply to human milk or more generally to bovine milk to pasteurize or stabilize the milk modify the structure of the natural emulsion. Heat treatment for instance induces whey proteins denaturation and the adsorption of protein aggregates on the surface of the milk fat globules. Heat treatment also leads to the denaturation of bile salt stimulated lipase. These effects limit intragastric lipolysis in preterm newborns.

Conversely, reduction of milk globules size, by homogenisation of milk, increases the specific surface available for lipase adsorption and limits the lost of fat during enteral administration of milk. Such treatment could thus enhance gastric lipolysis and improve fat absorption of preterm newborns.

The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of physical treatments (pasteurization and homogenisation by ultrasonication) applied to human milk on gastric lipolysis and milk destructuration. This trial is conducted, in vivo, on preterm newborns.";2014-04-28T00:00:00;;Completed;2016-04-28T00:00:00;Actual;2014-03-25T00:00:00;2014-04-09T00:00:00;Interventional;;20.0;Actual;"[{'ReferencePMID': '29072162', 'ReferenceType': 'derived', 'ReferenceCitation': 'de Oliveira SC, Bellanger A, Ménard O, Pladys P, Le Gouar Y, Henry G, Dirson E, Rousseau F, Carrière F, Dupont D, Bourlieu C, Deglaire A.

Despite encouraging results, the use of robotic equipment for gait training remains limited, even if they meet a strong social demand. The reasons for this situation are economic, but also related to the non consideration of the context of utilization . It is therefore important to involve the users of the innovation in the development process because it is the latter that will broadcast. Psychosocial perspective of the acceptability of the technology meets this need by including the users' perceptions toward device (s).

The ROBO-K project aimed at developping a mobile and interactive robot, dedicated to the rehabilitation of balance and gait at an early stage. It was intended for patients with impaired walking vascular neurological, traumatic or associated with chronic neurological disease. The first step for its developement was conducted with the psychosocial approach of Technology acceptability which has required specific methods for collecting the views of users and analysis of the activity.

For tuberculosis treatment the dosage of 10 mg/kg/j is usually prescribed, while in the treatment of Staphylococcus spp. infections the highest dosage of 20 mg/kg/j is proposed by French experts' recommendations from 2009.

However, there is little evidence in the literature, which could set out arguments to choose the best dosage of rifampicin, which may vary from 5 to 20 mg/kg.

The issue with rifampicin is side effects, in particular with long-term treatment. Many side effects may occur in 10 to 20% of patients and sometimes leads to dosage reduction or treatment interruption.

In the literature, there is little evidence that higher rifampicin dosage is associated with higher frequency of adverse effects. Depending on the nature of the toxicity, one could say that hypersensitivity could be independent from dosage, when digestive disorders may be related. Plasmatic concentrations studies have not given strong arguments to link higher rifampicin dosages with side effects occurrence rates. After oral absorption, plasmatic peak occurs after two to five hours and varies among individuals but also in the same patient overtime. This particular pharmacokinetic profile could explain discrepancy in adverse events (AEs) frequencies.";2016-01-28T00:00:00;;Completed;2020-12-28T00:00:00;Actual;2015-11-03T00:00:00;2015-11-05T00:00:00;Interventional;;544.0;Actual;[];0.0;False;;Rennes University Hospital;['France'];['Pau hospital', 'Angers university hospital', 'Bordeaux university hospital', 'Caen university hospital', 'La Roche sur Yon hospital', 'Saint-Malo hospital', 'Lorient hospital', 'Nantes university hospital', 'Rennes university hospital', 'Toulouse university hospital', 'Brest university hospital', 'Vannes hospital', 'Poitiers university hospital', 'Tours university hospital', 'Saint-Brieuc hospital', 'Clinique du Parc et Hôpital Jean Mermoz'];2022-11-28;2016.0;2020.0;-86.0;before_start;1796.0;academique;True;Completed;['fr'];;[];Drug;Randomized;Treatment;2015-001519-11;;;;;;;;

The consequence is the absence of parasympathetic control of the distal bowel from the anal sphincter to various levels. The most common type of Hirschsprung disease alters the rectosigmoid (80%). The incidence is around 1/5000 live births. This anomaly requires a surgical ablation of the aganglionic segment.

Regardless of the surgical complications, patients with Hirschsprung disease are exposed to the risk of Hirschsprung Associated EnteroColitis (HAEC). This variable risk, 4-54%, is responsible to a major part of Hirschsprung disease morbimortality. Its onset is more frequent during the first two years of life and then decrease with age.

Its pathogenesis remains unclear but could be due to intestinal homeostasis breakdown that involves microbiota, intestinal barrier, immune system and enteric nervous system. This breakdown of the mutual benefit relation due to microbiota or bowel anomaly is known to be responsible of Crohn's disease onset. Some studies emphasize the role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of HAEC, but the techniques or the methodology with small numbers of patients limit any conclusion or clinical use.

The study hypothesizes microbiota is a major factor in HAEC onset and in their functional bowel problems. Considering HAEC is more frequent the first two years, it's thought that intestinal microbiota changes with time in those patients. This project is innovative because it will use high throughput sequencing methods and analysis for microbiome analysis on fecal samples from a multicenter cohort of patients at various ages.

Multicentre transversal study.

This study has the potential to significantly modify clinical practice for Hirschsprung disease patients: a better care for HAEC and functional troubles thanks to a better understanding of their microbiota, targetted antibiotic treatment for HAEC, prophylactic treatment of patients at high risk of HAEC.";2016-06-28T00:00:00;;Completed;2018-09-28T00:00:00;Actual;2016-08-02T00:00:00;2016-08-02T00:00:00;Interventional;;118.0;Actual;"[{'ReferencePMID': '35847080', 'ReferenceType': 'derived', 'ReferenceCitation': ""Arnaud AP, Cousin I, Schmitt F, Petit T, Parmentier B, Levard G, Podevin G, Guinot A, DeNapoli S, Hervieux E, Flaum V, De Vries P, Randuineau G, David-Le Gall S, Buffet-Bataillon S, Boudry G.
